# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Features to be implemented:
1. GFE and HUD-1 Analyzer

2. Develop functions to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) like cash flow, return on investment (ROI), capitalization rate, and occupancy rates.

3.React frontend, develop components for displaying analytics. Use libraries like Chart.js or Recharts for visualizing data in the form of graphs and charts.
Implement filters and options on the UI for users to customize reports based on specific properties, date ranges, or other criteria.

4.Create a system for managing legal documents related to property transactions, including lease agreements, purchase contracts, and compliance documents.

5.Implement real-time alerts for various activities like payment due dates, maintenance updates, and market changes.
