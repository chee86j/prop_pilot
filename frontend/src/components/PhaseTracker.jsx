        This file needs to be updated tomorrow to integrate the timeline
        component to be displayed in the PropertyDetails component to help the
        user set target goal dates vs their actual dates to help with scheduling
        their lifecycle phases. This is to add functionality to display phases,
        set and adjust dates, and interact with the backend to update phase
        data. Specific Changes: Implement the timeline UI, including markers for
        each phase and interactive elements for setting dates. Manage state for
        phase data and handle CRUD operations for phases. Integrate with backend
        API endpoints to fetch and update phase data.
